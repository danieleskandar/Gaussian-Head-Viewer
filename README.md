## Gaussian Head Viewer

![Banner image](assets/banner.png)

Gaussian Head Viewer is a lightweight and specialized tool for visualizing dynamic Gaussian splatting models of human heads with hair. Optimized for compatibility with models referenced in _(paper)_, it enables users to explore and manipulate intricate head models with dynamic hair effects. It uses PyOpenGL, keeps dependencies minimal, and does not require a CUDA GPU.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Eskandar/Gaussian-Head-Viewer.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch viewer:

```bash
python main.py
```

Refer to the help window for GUI instructions.

## Models

The Gaussian file loader is compatible with the official implementation and works best with models as described in _(paper)_. Sample models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xwkqxQoLfkvDqnNHPqKXFU2KNDkx6-Ad/view?usp=drive_link).

For hair strand files, ensure the gaussians' means, scales, and rotations are the first rows in the `.ply` file. To save the number of hair strands (`n_strands`) and the number of gaussians per strand (`n_gaussians_per_strand`), run the following command:

```bash
python utils/util.py my_path --n_strands=12000 --n_gaussians_per_strand=31
```

To load precomputed rotation matrices for curls (instead of computing them on the fly), use the following command:

```bash
python utils/frenet_arcle.py my_path n_samples=10 --n_clusters=2 --max_amp=0.025 --max_freq=3
```

-   `n_samples`: Number of evenly spaced values for both amplitude and frequency.
-   `max_amp`: Maximum value for amplitude (inclusive).
-   `max_freq`: Maximum value for frequency (inclusive).
-   `n_clusters`: Number of hair clusters, each with strands sharing the same frequency and curling behavior.

For faster loading of frames and reduced read operations, run the following script:

```bash
python utils/frame_packer.py my_path --rot_format {quat, mat}
```

It takes the directory containing the files `frame_#_mean_frenet.npy`, `frame_#_rot_frenet.npy` , and `frame_#_scale_frenet.npy`. Specify whether the rotation is represented as a quaternion or rotation matrix (quat or mat).

Finally, to load FLAME Gaussian models, use the `Open Head Avatar from Folder` button. The folder should contain two `.ply` files:

-   `hair.ply`: Contains the hair Gaussian data (with `n_strands` and `n_gaussians_per_strand`).
-   `head.ply`: Contains the head Gaussian data.
